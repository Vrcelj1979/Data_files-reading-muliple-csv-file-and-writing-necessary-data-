# Data_files-reading-muliple-csv-file-and-writing-necessary-data-

Dear all,

I was using pandas python for reading multiple csv files and writing necessary data from csv files for my project.
You can use this code in every day work with csv files. 
In file PS Logistika multifile.py you have exemple where you read multiple csv file and manipulate with them.
In file PS Logistika.py you have example where you read only one csv file and manipulate with them.
In file panda_excel.py you have example where you read and write excel file.

Pay attention on letters: č,ć,đ,ž and import strinks when pandas first read csv files, 
only then you can get normaly result, other ways you will have error.

Best regard,
Slobodan Vrcelj
