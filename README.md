# Data_files-reading-muliple-csv-file-and-writing-necessary-data-

Dear all,

I was using pandas python for reading multiple csv files and writing necessary data from csv files for my project.
You can use this code in every day work with csv files. Also you can read excel file and I will write separate 
python file with excel posibility.
Pay attention on letters: č,ć,đ,ž and import strinks when pandas first read csv files, 
only then you can get normaly result, other ways you will have error.

Best regard,
Slobodan Vrcelj
